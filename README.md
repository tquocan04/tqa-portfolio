## 👨‍💻 About The Project
Welcome to my personal workspace! This repository houses the source code for my professional portfolio website. It is a centralized hub where I showcase my journey as a **Software Engineer**, highlighting my technical evolution and the projects I've built.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
I leveraged a modern development stack to ensure scalability and performance:
- **Frontend:** `React.js` with `React-Bootstrap` for structural components.
- **Animations:** `Framer Motion` and `Typewriter-effect` for an engaging UI.
- **Styling:** `CSS3` with a focus on custom Dark Mode aesthetics.
- **Deployment:** `Vercel` for continuous integration and delivery.

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Interactive UI:** Smooth transitions and dynamic background effects.
- **Fully Responsive:** Optimized for all screen sizes.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `src/components`: The core UI building blocks (Home, About, Projects, Resume).
- `src/assets`: Icons and personal media assets.
- `public`: Static resources and global configuration files.
