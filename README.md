## 👨‍💻 About The Project
Welcome to my personal workspace! This repository houses the source code for my professional portfolio website. It is a centralized hub where I showcase my journey as a **Software Engineer**, highlighting my technical evolution and the projects I've built.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
I leveraged a modern development stack to ensure scalability and performance:
* **Frontend:** `React.js` with `React-Bootstrap` for structural components.
* **Animations:** `Framer Motion` and `Typewriter-effect` for an engaging UI.
* **Styling:** `CSS3` with a focus on custom Dark Mode aesthetics.
* **Deployment:** `Vercel` for continuous integration and delivery.

## 🌟 Key Features
- **Modern UI/UX:** Optimized Dark Mode with interactive particles and smooth transitions.
- **Fully Responsive:** Ensures a perfect viewing experience across all devices, from mobile to desktop.
- **Dynamic Content:** Integrated with GitHub API to reflect my real-time coding activity and contributions.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `src/components`: The core UI building blocks (Home, About, Projects, Resume).
- `src/assets`: Stores images, icons, and media assets used throughout the site.
- `public`: Static resources and global configuration files.
